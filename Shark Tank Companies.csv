If you've ever felt paranoid about whether you're really getting decaf, and making sure that you're not unwittingly setting yourself up for a sleepless night, Caffeindicator could be for you. Caffeindicator is a litmus-like indicator to test whether coffee is regular or decaf. But this isn't a stand-alone product, at least not the way it was pitched.

It would have been a good idea for distribution, since it takes advantage of how these packets are already ubiquitous. Unfortunately for the caffeine-averse though, this product still hasn't hit the market, even years after its Shark Tank debut.
